# Qt_Linguist_Demo_APP
The Qt Linguist Language Demo App showcases the power and flexibility of Qt's internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) features using Qt Linguist. This lightweight application provides a practical demonstration of how developers can seamlessly integrate multi-language support into their Qt-based projects.
